On Mac:
Set the terminal directory to where the repo is located, and compile using $ make main
Run the compiled file using $ ./main
It will ask you for the image filename, don't forget to include the .ppm extension!
Fortunately if you forget to type the extension you can always add/change it later.
Mac's Preview allows you to view .ppm files so you don't need to install additional .ppm viewer programs, but you can.
Additionally, once the .ppm file is created, you can simply change the extension into more common type such as .jpg or .png
